# 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

I have built a new layout for my webpage and add some elements. 
In this project I used CSS and Bootstrap Framework, Javascript and Jquery (just to make my icon-bar works). 
Here are the changes I did:

* Creation of a New Layout;
* Addition of Viewport element in HTML;
* Addition of Bootstrap.css (v3.0.3);
* Addition of Fonts (Font Awesome 4.0.3 and Google Font);
* Addition of Favicon (Letter "R" in Google Style);
* Addition of JQuery Library (Otherwise the bar button wouldn't work and I'd keep receiving this error message: 
                              "Uncaught Error: Bootstrap requires jQuery at bootstrap.min.js:7");
* Addition of a Javascript function for a Responsive Menu;
* My code was based in the concept of DIVs but without forgetting semantics (navbar, footer);
* Addition of Alt attibutes in all images;
* Usage of Grid concept (container, rows, columns);
* Addition of a new webpage ("about_full.html"), merely because I wanted to do something different;
* Addition of Forms in "contact.html" (Ps.: I meant to disabled the "Submit" button for learning purpose and
  also because it was not going to do anything...yet);
* Addition of comments along the code (so it makes easier future alterations).


* Ps.: There are some comments defioned as Hints that are only in this project so I don't forget them in the future.
       Please ignore them.



Sorry, about this readme. I didn't have time to create something better, but I will. :)
